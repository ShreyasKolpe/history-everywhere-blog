# history-everywhere-blog
A repo for my personal blog.

Coded with Django and hosted at [Python Anywhere](http://www.pythonanywhere.com). 
Django tutorial [Programming with Harry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK8cqdr55Tsv-D2HMdrnD32oOVBNvmxjr) is 
a great first introduction to Django, importantly to get things up and working. Django docs are an excellent next step. 

Front end made with HTML, Bootstrap and CSS, following the theme at [my personal website.](https://shreyaskolpe.com/)
